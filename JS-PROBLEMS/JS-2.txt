1.) Remove Leading and Trailing Spaces (Trim)
Return a new string with spaces removed from start and end only.

Input: "  hello  " → Output: "hello"
Input: "   js" → Output: "js"
Input: "world   " → Output: "world"





2.) First Word of a Sentence
Characters from start until first space. If no space, whole string.

Input: "Hello world" → Output: "Hello"
Input: "JavaScript is fun" → Output: "JavaScript"
Input: "SingleWord" → Output: "SingleWord"





3.) Length of Longest Word in a Sentence
Return just the number (length of the longest word).

Input: "I love coding" Words: I(1), love(4), coding(6) → Output: 6

Input: "JavaScript is awesome" Words: JavaScript(10), is(2), awesome(7) → Output: 10

Input: "hi" → Output: 2






4.) Shortest Word in a Sentence
Return the actual word with minimum length (if tie, you can return first shortest).

Input: "I love coding" → Words: I, love, coding → Output: "I"
Input: "Java is fun" → Words: Java, is, fun → Shortest = "is" → Output: "is"
Input: "one two three" → All length 3 → Output: "one" (or first)





5.) Move All Negative Numbers to Front
Reorder array so that all negatives come before non-negatives (0 and positives). Order within groups can be ignored.

Input: [1, -2, 3, -4, 0] → Possible Output: [-2, -4, 1, 3, 0]
Input: [-1, -2, -3] → Output: [-1, -2, -3]
Input: [1, 2, 3] → Output: [1, 2, 3]





6.). Anagram Check (Ignore Spaces and Case)
Two strings are anagrams if they use same letters in same counts, order doesn’t matter.

Input: "listen", "silent" → Output: true
Input: "Dormitory", "Dirty room" → After ignoring spaces & case → Output: true
Input: "hello", "world" → Output: false






7.) A pangram contains every letter a–z at least once (ignore case and non-letters).

Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog" → Output: true
Input: "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow" → Output: true
Input: "Hello world" → Output: false





8.) Automorphic Number
A number is automorphic if its square ends with the same digits as the number.

Input: n = 5 → 5² = 25 → ends with 5 → Output: true
Input: n = 6 → 6² = 36 → ends with 6 → Output: true
Input: n = 7 → 7² = 49 → does not end with 7 → Output: false






9.) Rotate Array Right by k Positions
Right rotation: last elements move to front.

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1 → Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2 → Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3], k = 5 k % 3 = 2 → Output: [2, 3, 1]






10.) Merge Two Sorted Arrays into One Sorted Array
Both arrays are sorted; merge into a single sorted array (without sorting at the end).

Input: [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4, 6] → Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Input: [1, 2, 2] and [2, 3] → Output: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

Input: [] and [1, 2] → Output: [1, 2]






11.) Bubble Sort/Selection Sort/Insertion Sort (Ascending)
Sort an array using bubble sort algorithm.

Input: [3, 1, 4, 2] → Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Input: [5, 5, 5] → Output: [5, 5, 5]
Input: [-1, 3, 0] → Output: [-1, 0, 3]
